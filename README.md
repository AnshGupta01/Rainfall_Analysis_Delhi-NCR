# Rainfall Forecasting & Trend Analysis in Delhi NCR

## Project Overview

This project leverages satellite-derived monthly rainfall data to analyze, visualize, and predict rainfall patterns in Delhi NCR over a decade. Aimed at supporting water resource management, agriculture, and urban planning, the work offers scientifically-backed insights and forecasts.

## Why This Project?

Rainfall is a vital driver of agriculture, water supply, and disaster management. With climate variability, understanding long-term trends and anticipating future rainfall is crucial. This project combines remote sensing data, statistical trend detection, and machine learning to deliver an end-to-end rainfall analysis pipeline, empowering policymakers and stakeholders with actionable predictions.

## What Have I Used?

- **Data Source:** NASA GPM IMERG Monthly Satellite Data `NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_MONTHLY_V07` (in mm/month) 
- **Tools & Libraries:**  
  - Google Earth Engine (GEE) for cloud-based data access  
  - Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for data handling and visualization  
  - Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow Keras for machine learning and deep learning models  
  - Geemap for interactive spatial mapping  
- **Approach:**  
  - Spatial-temporal analysis of rainfall patterns  
  - Trend detection with Mann-Kendall test  
  - Feature engineering for seasonality and lag effects  
  - Multi-model forecasting (RF, XGBoost, LSTM) for robust prediction  

## Why Is This a Good ML Project?

- **Real-World Relevance:** Tackles climate change impact and water management challenges  
- **Innovative Use of Satellite Data:** Transforms satellite raster data into actionable insights  
- **Integrated Pipeline:** From data acquisition and preprocessing to trend analysis and future prediction  
- **Interactivity & Visualization:** Clear maps and plots for stakeholder communication  
- **Reproducibility & Extensibility:** Modular ML models and open data access ensure adaptability for other regions or datasets
